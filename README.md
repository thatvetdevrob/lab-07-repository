## Overview
We are iulding an aplication that can see the location anywhere in america, return 1 result, check the weather, and get back 5 trails back.

## Getting Started
Just rewirk a newer version of the last lab and this time use API, which you need the API keps from the places and place them in to the env file. Speaking of which you need to make the ENViromental keys accesible via variables and use gitignore to not display them.

## Architecture
we are using json, api, i belive mustache, and also lots of javascript. This along NPM and nodejs
